%\section{Conclusão}

Having acquired the theory of reinforcement learning to be used in this work, now we make plans on how to use it. The PPO algorithm is already implemented in the OpenAI website (citar), so the work required is to build the bridge between the RoboCup server program and the already constructed implementation of the algorithm. For the neural network, we plan to use TensorFlow.
Here are the intended objectives with deadlines:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Build the bridge between  OpenAI and RoboCup program.
	\item Build the model for the learning algorithm.
	\item Start training.
	\item Analise results and iterate the model until good results appear.
\end{enumerate}
